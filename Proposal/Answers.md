1. The Tech Stack for FirstFive will include Node, React, and possibly react-bootstrap.

2. The back-end will be my main focus. Although - I intend to make the application as evenly focused for a useable/ scalable full-stack application. 

3. FirstFive will be a website.

4. The FirstFive goals and research can be seen in file FirstFive.md.

5. The demographic of the app is small business owners, or early career professionals working within UX design, or software development. All users will have less than 5 years owning a business or working in their field.

6. The following data will be collected:

User name, username, email, phone-number, type of user (business owner or early career professional) 
Optional: Bio, target goal, maybe a picture

There is no existing API will the relevant data I need, therefore, I am creating a database w/ sample data and allowing users to add on as accounts are created. 

7. 
A. Please see DBBreakdown for schema.


B. In creating the API securing the message feature will be important and may cause issues.


C. Yes, I need to secure the users password, and the messages to and from users.


D. App features will include CRUD + private message features to allow companies & early professionals to chat.

E. Stretch goals - allow include a "pairing" option. Business owners & early professionals can complete a form with key items they're looking for. Based on that input the app can show the companies/ users that match their goals.
